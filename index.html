                <p>Wikipedians (people who edit Wikipedia articles)
                    have profile pages called User Pages, these pages are often littered with colorful boxes, called
                    Userboxes. Most Wikipedians use their Userboxes as a way to tell inside jokes about Wikipedia.
                    Although they started out on a much more serious note: to denote the fluency of languages spoken by
                    Wikipedians.</p>
                <p>These userboxes are no longer bound to purely funcional uses. Wikipedians have started using them to
                    display their interests. </p>
                <p>I personally first encountered Userboxes a couple months ago, when I first started doing the
                    occational Wikipedia edit. I was quite amazed that there is a hidden social network of people's
                    interests on this website that I've been using for the past 10 years.</p>

            <p>Userboxes started off initially as a way to communicate across multiple languages in Wikipedia, they were
                originally named Babel templates, after the Tower of Babel</p>
                <p>The Tower of Babel is a story from the Old Testament, where people are trying to build a Tower to heaven,
                    but God punishes them and makes sure everyone are divided by making sure people start speaking in
                    different languages, instead of in one universal language which (according to the story) was the case
                    before the tower was build. </p>
                    <p>The Babel templates wants to fix this division in knowledge, by bringing Wikipedians who speak different languages together. These boxes with Wikipedians language proficiencies, eventually evolved into userboxes with programming languages, nationalities, hobbies and much more.</p>
                    <p>Now the question is of course, does this range of different interests on Wikipedians Userpages actually bring people together? Does it make sure that people communicate about their interests with other Wikipedians? I interviewed a Wikipedian about this.</p>

                <h3>When did you first come into contact with Userboxes?</h3>

                <p>I would say that I noticed Userboxes
                    from the moment I started editing Wikipedia back in 2010, but my interest in them grew more
                    gradually over time.</p>

                <h3>Why do you like putting Userboxes on your User Page?</h3>

                <p>For me, Userboxes are a way to express my true personality and beliefs, and to connect with people
                    who might be on the &quot;same page&quot; as me (to the point of &quot;online friendship&quot; or
                    &quot;relationship&quot;). I also &quot;collect&quot; those userboxes that I consider to be
                    interesting or amusing, for reasons ofÂ  humor or irony.</p>

                <h3>Did you meet any friends, acquaintances, or romantic partners on Wikipedia through Userboxes, or do
                    you have any examples of Wikipedians who did?</h3>

                <p>Unfortunately, I can't say that I ever met any friends, acquaintances, or romantic partners in a
                    Wikipedia-related way, involving Userboxes or not. At least so far; I surely hope it will happen
                    eventually... Also, I can't really recall some examples of Wikipedians who did.</p>
                <h3>How do you find new Userboxes to put on your User Page?</h3>

                <p>I usually find new Userboxes by looking at various categories represented at Template:WikiProject
                    Userboxes navbox. Also, I consider myself to be a true Userbox kleptomaniac, as I often randomly
                    look at various Userpages, and simply copy-paste those Userboxes that I am interested in somehow.
                </p>


                <h3>When do you decide to make a new Userbox, do you make Userboxes for others, or just for your own
                    interests?</h3>

                <p>When I decide to make a new Userbox, I usually do it both for others and for my own interests.
                    Anyway, I almost always add a new Userbox at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Userboxes/New Userboxes, so
                    that other users may easily see them.</p>
