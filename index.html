                <h3>When did you first come into contact with Userboxes?</h3>

                <p><span id="UserSundostund" class="user">User:Sundostund</span> I would say that I noticed Userboxes from the moment I started editing Wikipedia back in 2010, but my interest in them grew more gradually over time.</p>
                
                <h3>Why do you like putting Userboxes on your User Page?</h3>
                
                <p>For me, Userboxes are a way to express my true personality and beliefs, and to connect with people who might be on the &quot;same page&quot; as me (to the point of &quot;online friendship&quot; or &quot;relationship&quot;). I also &quot;collect&quot; those userboxes that I consider to be interesting or amusing, for reasons ofÂ  humor or irony.</p>
                
                <h3>How do you find new Userboxes to put on your User Page?</h3>
                
                <p>I usually find new Userboxes by looking at various categories represented at Template:WikiProject Userboxes navbox. Also, I consider myself to be a true Userbox kleptomaniac, as I often randomly look at various Userpages, and simply copy-paste those Userboxes that I am interested in somehow.</p>
                
                <h3>When do you decide to make a new Userbox, do you make Userboxes for others, or just for your own interests?</h3>
                
                <p>When I decide to make a new Userbox, I usually do it both for others and for my own interests. Anyway, I almost always add a new Userbox at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Userboxes/New Userboxes, so that other users may easily see them.</p>
